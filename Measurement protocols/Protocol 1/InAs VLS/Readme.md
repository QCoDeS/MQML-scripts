InAs VLS pinch-off curves
Four probe devices with universal back-gate
Sourcing with AC and DC bias using standard lock-in technique 
Multiple device measurements (D) and multiple repetitions (N) to stabilize the profile of the curves.

Measurement specifications:
Vg:           Gate voltage​
Vgmin, Vgmax: Minimum and maximum gate seep voltage​

VSD​:          Source-drain bias voltage
VAC:          AC voltage excitation
f:            frequency of the AC signal
tcI:          time constant for the current signal
tcV:          time constant for the voltge signal
dB_slope:     filter cut-off slope
ACdiv:        AC divider
DCdiv:        DC divider
GIamp:        Gain for the current response
GVamp:        Gain for the voltage response


j​:            Sweep rate​
T:            Temperature ​
B​:            Magnetic field​
N​:            Number of repetitions​
D:            Number of devices measured simultaneously
