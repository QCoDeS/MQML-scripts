POC Jordan

InAs SAG pinch-off curves
Four probe devices with top gate
Sourcing with DC bias. 
Single device measurements and multiple repetitions (N) to stabilize the profile of the curve.

Measurement specifications:
Vg:           Gate voltage​
Vgmin, Vgmax: Minimum and maximum gate seep voltage​
ISD​:          Source-drain current​
j​:            Sweep rate​
T:            Temperature ​
B​:            Magnetic field​
N​:            Number of repetitions​

Values:
Vgmin = -2 V
Vgmax = +7 V
ISD   = 10 nA       [need to be tested and specified]
j     = 0.5 V/sev  [need to be tested and specified]
