Protocol 1.1
VLS and SAG NWs with standard lock-in technique
<br>
The code can be used for 1, 2 or 3 devices silmutaneously
<br>
This version supports both 4-probe and 2-probe measurements
<br>
<br>
This code investigates charge effects on the device while the limits of backgate voltage are expanded
<br>
Source-drain bias voltage, temperature and magnetic field can be added as extra parameters
